## TL;DR

- We can learn about something new (GitHub Pages) and bring together other skills we've learned at the same time 

## Motivating use case: a simple website with GitHub Pages

- GitHub Pages is a service provided by GitHub that will turn a GitHub repo into a static website. It's used a lot for personal websites, project documentation, and the like.
- We can use the stuff we've learned so far to very quickly and easily start working on a little website.

## Skills we'll exercise

- Basic git workflow: `git {clone, status, add, commit, push, pull, checkout, log}`
- Next steps with git: `branch` and `merge` and the `.gitignore` file
- Basic shell navigation
- Develop on a dev branch and merge to master when we're ready
- Let's assume we already have our [ssh keys](keys.md) set up

## GitHub Pages

- [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) is a web hosting service built into GitHub.
